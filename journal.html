                I started my first project creating a functioning calculator. 
            Today I finished writing the HTML and part of the CSS. 
            I am struggling to move the calculator to the center of the website. 
            Tomorrow I will start on the JavaScript and make the calculator functional.

        <p> 
                I finished writing the CSS. 
            I was able to move the calculator to the center my putting a <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> around my <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag. 
            I wanted to create a soothing vibe and ascetic feel to the calculator when you open up the website. 
            I started writing the javascript, but I am stuck why my squareroot function’s solutions always ends up as undefined.

            I finished writing the javascript! 
            I was able to fix the problem with the squareroot’s solution always ending up as undefined. 
            I needed to change the code for the calculateResult and calculateSquareRoot functions. 
            Now I have created a function calculator. I might add some sound effects and other moving things. 
            Or even add more functions and other stuff to the calculator itself!
        </p>

        <p>
                I added sounds to the calculator. 
            Whenever you press a key, a sound gets played. 
            In addition to adding sounds, I added the function to type to use the calculator. 
            Also I added an abbreviation key, and keyboard shortcuts on the right of the calculator. 
            I am now struggling to put the calculator in the center and put the text to the right of it. 
            If the calculator isn’t in the center, it gives me the icks and it also doesn’t look right. 
            After I figure out how to fix this, I will start on a new project, or add new functions, 
            including memory, tan, cos, sin, power too, or even parenthesis!

        <p>
            Today I uploaded my website and calculator to GitHub and created GitHub Pages for both repositories.
            I also made some final tweaks to the calculator's design and functionality to ensure a better user experience.
            Moving forward, I plan to start a new project, however I am unsure of what to create next.
            I have a few ideas in mind, such as a to-do list app or a weather app, 
            but I need to do more research and planning before I begin.
            In addition, I added comments to my code in the calculator project to improve its readability and maintainability for my classmates and future self.

            Today I create a moving thing in class. it was okay. im lowkey bored ngl. I only have 2 more classes.
            after that I can finally relax and do whatever I want. maybe make more projects or just chill.
            I might also try to learn more about web development and explore new technologies and frameworks.
            overall, im just excited for the end of the semester and the start of a new chapter in my life.

            Today I create did some Project Euler problems. It was fun and challenging. I like solving problems and learning new things.
            I plan to do more Project Euler problems in the future to improve my coding skills and logical thinking.
            I also want to explore other areas of programming, such as web development, data science, and machine learning.
            Overall, I am excited to continue my coding journey and see where it takes me. I also pushed it onto GitHub and on my website.
